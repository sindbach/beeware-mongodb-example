# BeeWare + MongoDB Example 


* Briefcase: https://github.com/beeware/briefcase
* The BeeWare Project: https://beeware.org/
* MongoDB Python driver (PyMongo): https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
* MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.com/


This is an example BeeWare application (extending Hello World example) that uses PyMongo. It inserts a random document into a local MongoDB (install separately), and display them on a table.
